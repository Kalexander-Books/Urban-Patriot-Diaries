# Urban-Patriot-Diaries

Hello Urban Patriots

I should like to think of myself as a crisis theorist, because, just because something works doesn't make it workable, for everything and everybody. Not a functionalist who believes don't fix something if it works... for even a few.

Rural, suburban way of life is a cop-out... city/urban life's the thick of it all, gives life a dash spice. And, since I believe the great experiment (Democracy), is worth pursuing, I'm a Patriot of Democracy. Hence: URBAN PATRIOT.

The only story more important than tales of truth's, are stories of explanations behind the lies; that the Red White and Blue, of white folk, don't need fixing. Becasue it does need fixing. And I'm here to ask why, now that it's clear. Through literary fiction/non-fiction stories.

It's necessary to make this change clear to avoid confusion about this site project.
